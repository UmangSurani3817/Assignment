    How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?

    Ans - To control the repetition of an image in the background, use the background-repeat property. You can use no-repeat value for the background-repeat property if you do not want to repeat an image, in this case, the image will display only once.

    body {
    background-image: url("paper.gif");
    background-repeat: repeat;
    }
