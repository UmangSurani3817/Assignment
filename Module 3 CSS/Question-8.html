    What is the use of background position property?

    Ans - The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image.

          Tip: By default, a background-image is placed at the top-left corner of an element, and repeated both vertically and horizontally.

          body {
          background-image: url('w3css.gif');
          background-repeat: no-repeat;
          background-attachment: fixed;
          background-position: center top;
          }
